How to Install and Run the SDK
----
* **IntelliJ IDEA**

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA and select _File > Open..._.
2. Choose the java-maven-starter-project directory and click _OK_.
3. Select _File > Project Structure..._ and ensure that the Project SDK and language level are set to use Java 11.
4. Open the Maven view with _View > Tool Windows > Maven_.
5. In the Maven view, under _Plugins > dependency_, double-click the `dependency:unpack` goal. This will unpack the native libraries into $USER_HOME/.arcgis.
6. In the Maven view, run the `compile` phase under _Lifecycle_ and then the `exec:java` goal to run the app.

* **Eclipse**

1. Open Eclipse and select _File > Import_.
2. In the import wizard, choose _Maven > Existing Maven Projects_, then click _Next_.
3. Select the java-maven-starter-project as the project root directory.
4. Click _Finish_ to complete the import.
5. Select _Project > Properties_ . In _Java Build Path_, ensure that under the Libraries tab, _Modulepath_ is set to JRE System Library (JavaSE-11). In _Java Compiler_, ensure that the _Use compliance from execution environment 'JavaSE-11' on the 'Java Build Path'_ checkbox is selected.
6. Right-click the project in the Project Explorer or Package Explorer and choose _Run As > Maven Build..._. In the _Edit Configuration_ dialog, create a new configuration with name `unpack`. In the _Goals_ field, enter `dependency:unpack`. Click _Run_ to run the goal. This will unpack the native libraries into $USER_HOME/.arcgis.
7. Again, create a new run configuration with name `run`. In the _Goals_ field, enter `compile exec:java`. Click _Run_ to run the goal. The app should compile and launch the JavaFX window.

* **Prerequisites:**
  * Install the latest version of [Java](https://java.com) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.html).
  * Set the environment variable: `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=your-key-filename.json`
  * You may need to set your `JAVA_HOME`.

```bash
      cd java-docs-samples/storage/xml-api/cmdline-sample
      # Compile and run
      mvn compile install
      mvn -q exec:java -Dexec.args="your-bucket-name"
```

* **Run**

  * Right-click on project
  * Run As > Java Application
  * If asked, type "StorageSample" and click OK
